## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### 1. Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture
**Decision**: Built as SPA without routing library  
**Reasoning**: 
- Take-home challenge focuses on component library architecture, not navigation
- Healthcare dashboards benefit from single-view workflows (no context switching)
- Reduces complexity to showcase component design skills
- Better performance for real-time medical data updates

**Alternatives Considered**: Multi-page with React Router  
**Benefits**: Faster development, better component focus, clinical workflow optimization

### 2. CSS Modules + CSS Custom Properties
**Decision**: Custom styling system instead of utility frameworks  
**Reasoning**:
- Showcases advanced CSS architecture skills
- Component-scoped styling prevents style conflicts
- Design token system demonstrates scalable design thinking
- Better performance (only load CSS for used components)
- Full control over healthcare-specific styling needs

**Alternatives Considered**: Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, Material UI  
**Benefits**: Better component library showcase, healthcare customization, performance optimization

### 3. Custom Component Library from Scratch
**Decision**: Build all UI components without external UI libraries  
**Reasoning**:
- Demonstrates React component architecture expertise
- Shows understanding of accessibility implementation
- Allows healthcare-specific customizations
- Better showcases reusability and scalability concepts
- Provides complete control over medical data presentation

**Alternatives Considered**: Headless UI, Material UI, Ant Design  
**Benefits**: Technical skill demonstration, healthcare optimization, complete customization

## üé® Design System Decisions

### 4. Healthcare-Focused Color System
**Decision**: Medical status colors based on ISO 3864 standards  
**Reasoning**:
- **Critical Red (#dc2626)**: ISO standard for danger/emergency
- **Warning Orange (#d97706)**: Medical caution standard
- **Normal Green (#059669)**: Universal safe/healthy indicator
- **Pending Gray (#6b7280)**: Neutral for unknown status
- All colors meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)

**Alternatives Considered**: Generic color palettes, brand-focused colors  
**Benefits**: Medical safety compliance, accessibility, international standards

### 5. Mobile-First Responsive Design
**Decision**: Bottom tabs for mobile, sidebar for desktop  
**Reasoning**:
- Healthcare professionals often use mobile devices in clinical settings
- Bottom tabs provide native app feel (iOS/Android standard)
- One-handed operation critical for medical workflows
- Thumb-friendly navigation in 44px+ touch targets
- Desktop sidebar maximizes screen real estate for data

**Alternatives Considered**: Hamburger menu, desktop-first design  
**Benefits**: Clinical usability, native experience, accessibility

### 6. Accessibility-First Approach
**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as baseline requirement  
**Reasoning**:
- Healthcare applications must be accessible to all users
- Legal requirement in many healthcare systems
- Screen reader support critical for visually impaired medical staff
- Keyboard navigation essential for efficiency
- Color-blind accessibility prevents medical errors

**Alternatives Considered**: Basic accessibility, post-development accessibility  
**Benefits**: Legal compliance, inclusive design, error prevention


## üîß Technical Decisions

### 7. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
**Decision**: Latest stable versions of core technologies  
**Reasoning**:
- React 19: Latest features, performance improvements, concurrent rendering
- TypeScript: Type safety critical for medical data handling
- Vite: Fast development, excellent HMR, modern build tooling
- Demonstrates knowledge of current best practices

**Alternatives Considered**: Create React App, Next.js, older React versions  
**Benefits**: Performance, developer experience, modern features

### 8. Recharts for Data Visualization
**Decision**: Recharts over Chart.js or D3  
**Reasoning**:
- Built specifically for React (better integration)
- Excellent accessibility features out of the box
- Responsive by default
- Good TypeScript support
- Latest version (2.12.7) has React 19 compatibility

**Alternatives Considered**: Chart.js, D3.js, Victory Charts  
**Benefits**: React integration, accessibility, maintainability

## üè• Healthcare-Specific Decisions

### 9. Medical Data Presentation Patterns
**Decision**: Card-based layout with clear status indicators  
**Reasoning**:
- Reduces cognitive load for medical professionals
- Clear visual hierarchy prevents misreading critical values
- Status badges provide immediate visual feedback
- Consistent patterns across all medical data types
- Supports scanning workflows common in clinical settings

**Alternatives Considered**: Table-only layout, list-based presentation  
**Benefits**: Error reduction, workflow optimization, visual clarity

### 10. AI/Automation Disclaimers
**Decision**: Clear disclaimers for automated suggestions  
**Reasoning**:
- Legal requirement in many healthcare jurisdictions
- Maintains human oversight in medical decisions
- Builds trust through transparency
- Prevents over-reliance on automated systems
- Supports clinical judgment workflows

**Alternatives Considered**: Subtle indicators, no disclaimers  
**Benefits**: Legal compliance, trust building, safety
